-- Multiple Month: Churn Rate Calculation

-- Now comes the moment weâ€™ve been waiting for - the actual churn rate.
-- We use the number of canceled and active subscriptions 
-- to calculate churn for each month: churn_rate = canceled / active

-- Add a SELECT statement to calculate the churn rate. The result should contain two columns:
-- month - selected from status_aggregate
-- churn_rate - calculated from status_aggregate.canceled and status_aggregate.active.
