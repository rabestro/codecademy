-- Multiple Month: Determine Cancellation Status

-- For our calculation, weâ€™ll need one more column on the status temporary table: is_canceled
-- This column will be 1 only during the month that the user cancels.
-- Add an is_canceled column to the status temporary table. Ensure that it 
-- is equal to 1 in months containing the subscription_end and 0 otherwise.
-- Derive this column using a CASE WHEN statement. You can use the BETWEEN 
-- function to check if a date falls between two others.
