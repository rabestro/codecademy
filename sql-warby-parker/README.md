# Warby Parker

Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world — for every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, you will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that you are given:

Quiz Funnel:

    survey

Home Try-On Funnel:

    home_try_on
    purchase

Let’s get started!

Start the following project, which will guide you through the queries you need to write with a series of questions. Make sure to save your queries and results — you’ll be using them in your presentation.

Then, create a set of slides using Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should answer all of the questions in the project. Each answer should include a text explanation and data to support your claim. The queries used to find that data should be included in a separate .sql file.

- [Rubric](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/learn-sql-from-scratch/funnels-rubric-for-learners-ADwSQL.pdf): You can share your work with your peers on Codecademy, who can give you feedback based on this rubric. Make sure to check your work before submitting!
